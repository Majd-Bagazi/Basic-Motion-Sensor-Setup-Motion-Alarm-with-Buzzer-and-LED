 # Motion-Activated Alarm using Arduino and PIR Sensor

#Overview  
This project presents a practical implementation of a motion-triggered alarm system utilizing an Arduino Uno and a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor. Upon detecting movement, the system activates a piezo buzzer for audible alert and illuminates an LED for visual feedback. This real-time response setup is ideal for basic intrusion detection or entry notification.

#Components  
- Arduino Uno  
- PIR Motion Sensor  
- Piezo Buzzer  
- LED  
- Resistors  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper Wires

#Functionality  
The PIR sensor monitors infrared changes in its field of view. When motion is detected, the Arduino signals both the buzzer and LED to activate. This enables users to receive immediate sound and light alerts when motion occurs within the sensorâ€™s range.

#Educational Goals  
- Implement real-time response systems using Arduino  
- Explore sensor integration with sound and light outputs  
- Develop understanding of digital I/O operations  
- Design practical alarm mechanisms for beginner-level security applications

#Applications  
Ideal for prototype security systems, room entry alerts, and motion-activated devices in automation scenarios.

## Future Enhancements  
Further developments may include adding SMS or email notifications, integrating with IoT platforms, or enabling time-stamped motion logs for analysis.
